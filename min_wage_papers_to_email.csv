https://openalex.org/W4410235042,Public Finance Implications of Economic Inequality,Alan J. Auerbach,2025-05-01,"This paper considers questions about the implications of rising inequality for the theory and practice of public finance. It begins by addressing fundamental reasons why the distribution of income or wealth on an annual basis before taxes and transfers offers insufficient information: (1) it does not tell us what resources are actually available to households for consumption; and (2) in providing a snapshot of the resources available to individuals of different ages at a given moment in time, without controlling for life-cycle related differences or income dynamics, it can provide a misleading estimate of the underlying degree of inequality. The paper then considers the implications of high and perhaps rising economic inequality for the design of government policy: top marginal tax rates, phase-outs of government policies for those with higher incomes, the political economy of inequality, and other subjects.",The Journal of Economic Perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.20241421,new,2025-11-19,2025-11-19T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W4409464115,A Measure of Trend Wage Inflation,Martín Almuzara; Richard Audoly; Davide Melcangi,2025-04-14,"ABSTRACT We extend time‐series models that have so far been used to study price inflation and apply them to a microlevel data set containing worker‐level information on hourly wages. We construct a measure of aggregate nominal wage growth that (i) filters out noise and very transitory movements, (ii) quantifies the importance of idiosyncratic factors for aggregate wage dynamics, and (iii) strongly co‐moves with labor market tightness, unlike existing indicators of wage inflation. We show that our measure is a reliable real‐time indicator of wage pressures and a good predictor of future wage growth.",Journal of Applied Econometrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.3126,new,2025-11-19,2025-11-19T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W4410110223,What explains public support for Canada's supply management regime?,Ryan Cardwell; Chad Lawley,2025-05-01,"Abstract We investigate elasticity of policy preferences to information about the economic effects of policy tools. We survey approximately 5,000 people and ask a referendum question about liberalizing supply management in Canada. Supply management regulates production and marketing of dairy and poultry products in Canada through production restrictions, regulated pricing, and import barriers. Support varies widely across political‐party affiliation, and across individuals with different views on redistributive fiscal policies, international trade liberalization, and perceptions of how supply management affects food prices. We estimate causal effects of information about personal costs and distributional effects of supply management on support for the policy in a randomized experiment. Treated participants receive personalized information about how supply management affects household grocery costs, and information about the policy's distributional effects. Policy support is responsive to information treatments, but these effects are small relative to differences in support across individuals' views on economic issues such as international trade and fiscal redistribution policies. We find little evidence of heterogenous treatment effects across respondent characteristics, suggesting the effects of our information treatments are not tied to views about political and economic issues.",Canadian Journal of Economics/Revue canadienne d économique,https://doi.org/10.1111/caje.70009,new,2025-11-19,2025-11-19T00:00:00Z
