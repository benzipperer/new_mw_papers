w33720,Protection for Whom? The Political Economy of Protective Labor Laws for Women,Matthias Doepke; Hanno Foerster; Anne Hannusch; Michèle Tertilt,2025-04-24,"During the first half of the twentieth century, many US states enacted laws restricting women's labor market opportunities, including maximum hours restrictions, minimum wage laws, and night-shift bans. The era of so-called protective labor laws came to an end in the 1960s as a result of civil rights reforms. In this paper, we investigate the political economy behind the rise and fall of these laws. We argue that the main driver behind protective labor laws was men's desire to shield themselves from labor market competition. We spell out the mechanism through a politico-economic model in which singles and couples work in different sectors and vote on protective legislation. Restrictions are supported by single men and couples with male sole earners who compete with women for jobs. We show that the theory's predictions for when protective legislation will be introduced are well supported by US state-level evidence.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33720,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z

West,2024-11-07,"We combine societal-level institutional measures from 51 countries between 1996 and 2017 with individual decision-making outcome data from 1,126 laboratory experiments in six meta-analyses to evaluate the effects of within-country institutional change on pro-social and Nash behavior. We find that government effectiveness and regulatory freedom positively correlate with pro-social behavior. We find that freedom from each of the following components of regulation; interest rate controls, binding minimum wages, worker dismissal protections, conscription, and administrative requirements; are correlated with prosocial behavior and are inversely correlated with Nash behavior. These results suggest the importance of considering spillover effects in pro-social behavior when designing government policy.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33129,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w33167,Minimum Wages and Race Disparities,David Neumark; Jyotsana Kala,2024-11-14,"We provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of minimum wages on blacks, and on the relative impacts on blacks vs. whites. We study not only teenagers – the focus of much of the minimum wage-employment literature – but also other low-skill groups. We focus on employment, which has been the prime concern with the minimum wage research literature. We find evidence that job loss effects from higher minimum wages are more evident for blacks, and in contrast not very detectable for whites. Moreover, the effects of minimum wages are often large enough to generate adverse effects on earnings (and relative earnings) of blacks. Given strong residential segregation by race in the United States, the race difference in the effects of minimum wages implies that any adverse impacts fall on areas with a high black population share. We explore additional evidence on whether minimum wage effects are also more adverse in black areas, regardless of individual race. We find weak evidence of this heterogeneity, although it does accentuate the concentration of the adverse effects of minimum wages in areas where the black population is concentrated.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33167,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w33467,Labor Market Monopsony: Fundamentals and Frontiers,Patrick M. Kline,2025-02-13,"This chapter reviews the theory of monopsonistic wage setting, its empirical implications, and some puzzles the framework has struggled to explain. We begin by examining the fundamentals of monopsonistic wage determination. The core of the theory is a mapping from the distribution of worker outside options to wages. We study non-parametric shape restrictions that ensure this mapping is unique. Building on these results, we introduce a menu of tractable parametrizations of labor supply to the firm, some of which are shown to emerge naturally from equilibrium search models. Next, we review why wage markdowns do not necessarily signal inefficiency and discuss some criteria for assessing misallocation in a monopsony model with search frictions. Turning to the model’s empirical implications, we examine how the magnitude of productivity-wage passthrough depends on the super-elasticity of labor supply to the firm and establish that compensating differentials for firm amenities depend on the curvature of the outside option distribution. We show that firm-specific shifts in either productivity or amenities can be used as instruments to identify labor supply elasticities and review strategies for estimating non-constant elasticities. We then consider extensions of the basic model involving third-degree wage discrimination and examine their ability to rationalize patterns of worker-firm sorting. Monopsony models traditionally assume that firms commit to posted wages. Relaxing this assumption, we develop a connection between the first-order conditions of the monopsony model and models of bargaining with incomplete information. These models explain why bilateral inefficiencies may persist in the presence of negotiation, yield predictions about the response of within-firm wage dispersion to productivity shocks, and suggest reasons why some productivity shifters may not constitute excludable instruments. Next, we endogenize productivity by allowing for efficiency wages, non-constant returns to scale, and price-cost markups. Empirical monopsony estimates often suggest that firms enjoy implausibly large profit margins. We argue that allowing for non-constant labor supply elasticities and firm adjustment costs can potentially resolve this difficulty. Finally, we review why the strong passthrough of minimum wages to product prices presents a challenging puzzle for standard monopsony models and discuss potential reconciliations to this puzzle involving firm heterogeneity, quality upgrading, and lumpy price adjustment.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33467,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w34165,Robinson Meets Roy: Monopsony Power and Comparative Advantage,Mark Bils; Bariş Kaymak; Kai-Jie Wu,2025-08-21,"We provide a number of insights into the nature and consequences of monopsony power through the lens of comparative advantage, where employers’ power in wage setting stems from match-specific rents. Chief among them is that employers will apply larger wage markdowns to workers with greater comparative advantage at their firm. This leads to stronger monopsony power over more productive workers, provided the workers’ comparative advantage aligns with their absolute advantage. Using Brazilian administrative data, we confirm this prediction: monopsony disproportionately affects high-wage workers within firms and workers at high-paying firms. The model, calibrated to our estimates for Brazil, predicts that minimum wages increase both wages and formal employment for more productive workers while pushing less productive workers out of formal employment.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34165,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w33862,"City Size, Monopsony, and the Employment Effects of Minimum Wages",Priyaranjan Jha; Jyotsana Kala; David Neumark; Antonio Rodriguez-Lopez,2025-05-30,"We assess how minimum wage effects on restaurant employment in the U.S. vary with labor market size and monopsony power. Using city-level data, we construct monopsony proxies based on labor flows and concentration. Minimum wages bind less in larger cities, consistent with the urban wage premium, and omitting this relationship overstates how labor market power reduces adverse employment effects of minimum wages. Nonetheless, accounting for city size, lower job market fluidity is linked to weaker negative employment effects, consistent with search models. By contrast, traditional concentration measures do not consistently predict variation in the effects of minimum wages.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33862,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w34188,Minimum Wages and the Distribution of Firm Wage Premia,Marcelo L. Bergolo; Rodrigo Ceni; Mathias Fondo; Damián Vergara,2025-08-29,"This paper leverages a large minimum wage reform in Uruguay to study the effects of minimum wages on the distribution of firm wage premia. Wage inequality decreased substantially after the reform, with almost all of the decrease attributed to a reduction in between-firm inequality. AKM variance decompositions show that the relative variance of firm fixed effects substantially decreased after the reform. A time-varying AKM model reveals that this pattern was driven by a compression in the distribution of firm fixed effects, with low-paying firms increasing their fixed effect after the minimum wage increase. Both firm-level and worker-level difference-in-differences analyses show that the minimum wage reform had a causal effect on the compression in the distribution of firm wage premia. The results suggest that minimum wages can increase the supply of ""good jobs"" by ""making bad jobs better"", in addition to reallocating workers towards ""good jobs"".",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34188,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w33990,Effects of the Minimum Wage on Employment of Young Adults with Cognitive Disabilities,Barry Chiswick; Hope Corman; Dhaval M. Dave; Nancy Reichman,2025-07-03,"We estimate the effects of increases in the minimum wage on labor market outcomes of working-age adults with cognitive disabilities, a vulnerable and low-skilled group, using data from the American Community Survey (2008-2023) and a generalized difference-in-differences research design. We found that a higher effective minimum wage reduces employment and labor force participation but has no effect on labor supply at the intensive margin for this group. Effects were stronger for those with lower educational attainment. We found no significant labor market effects of an increase in the minimum wage for individuals with physical disabilities or in the non-disabled population.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33990,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w34244,Exposure to Science and Scientific Careers: Evidence from Minimum Wage Increases and University Lab Employment,Ina Ganguli; Raviv Murciano-Goroff,2025-09-11,"We study how exposure to scientific research in university laboratories influences students’ pursuit of careers in science. Using administrative data from thousands of research labs linked to student career outcomes and a difference-in-differences design, we show that state minimum wage increases reduce employment of undergraduate research assistants in labs by 7.4%. Undergraduates exposed to these minimum wage increases graduate with 18.1% fewer quarters of lab experience. Using minimum wage changes as an instrumental variable, we estimate that one fewer quarter working in a lab, particularly early in college, reduces the probability of working in the life sciences industry by 2 percentage points and of pursuing doctoral education by 7 percentage points. These effects are attenuated for students supported by the Federal Work-Study program. Our findings highlight how labor market policies can shape the career paths of future scientists and the importance of budget flexibility for principal investigators providing undergraduates with research experience.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34244,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w34405,Careers of Minimum Wage Workers,Sari Pekkala Kerr; William R. Kerr; Louis J. Maiden,2025-10-23,"We characterize the careers of minimum wage workers by merging SIPP panels covering 1992-2016 into the LEHD. A long-run analysis shows strong earnings growth for these workers in subsequent decades, becoming indistinguishable from peers earning modestly more initially. Most of this growth is due to the steep earnings trajectories of young workers. Older workers earning minimum wages show a modest dip in earnings at that moment compared to earlier and later periods. Increases in state minimum wages do not significantly alter the future careers of workers who are on the minimum wage when the increases occur.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34405,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w34033,Did California's Fast Food Minimum Wage Reduce Employment?,Jeffrey Clemens; Olivia Edwards; Jonathan Meer,2025-07-10,"We analyze the effect of California's $20 fast food minimum wage, which was enacted in September 2023 and went into effect in April 2024, on employment in the fast food sector. In unadjusted data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, we find that employment in California's fast food sector declined by 2.7 percent relative to employment in the fast food sector elsewhere in the United States from September 2023 through September 2024. Adjusting for pre-AB 1228 trends increases this differential decline to 3.2 percent, while netting out the equivalent employment changes in non-minimum-wage-intensive industries further increases the decline. Our median estimate translates into a loss of 18,000 jobs in California's fast food sector relative to the counterfactual.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34033,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w33433,Minimum Wage Laws and Job Search,Vitor C. Melo; Christopher Kaiser; David Neumark; Liya Palagashvili; Michael D. Farren,2025-01-31,"A large theoretical literature on job search predicts that a higher minimum wage will increase the number of job seekers for affected jobs, which can lead to more job creation and higher employment. This paper uses novel data on job search in all U.S. states to examine the effect of minimum wage increases on the number of job seekers for low-skilled positions. We find no evidence that higher minimum wages increase job search for low-skilled jobs. Instead, the evidence suggests that higher minimum wages decrease the number of workers seeking employment.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33433,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z

Gentry; Jonathan Meer,2025-01-31,"We analyze the differential effects of minimum wage increases on individuals with disabilities using data from the American Community Survey and leveraging state-level minimum wage variation during the 2010s. We find that large minimum wage increases significantly reduce employment and labor force participation for individuals of all working ages with severe disabilities. These declines are accompanied by a downward shift in the wage distribution and an increase in public assistance receipt. By contrast, we find no employment effects for all but young individuals with either non-severe disabilities or no disabilities. Our findings highlight important heterogeneities in minimum wage impacts, raising concerns about labor market policies’ unintended consequences for populations on the margins of the labor force.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33437,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w33479,"The Minimum Wage, Turnover, and the Shape of the Wage Distribution",Pierre R. Brochu; David A. Green; Thomas Lemieux; James H. Townsend,2025-02-13,"This paper proposes an empirical approach to decompose the distributional effects of minimum wages into effects for workers moving out of employment, workers moving into employment, and workers continuing in employment. We estimate the effects of the minimum wage on the hazard rate for wages, which provides a convenient way of re-scaling the wage distribution to control for possible employment effects. We find that minimum wage increases do not result in an abnormal concentration of Job Leavers below the new minimum wage, which is inconsistent with employment effects predicted by a neoclassical model. We also find that, for Job Stayers, the spike and spillover effects of the minimum wage are simply shifted right to the new minimum wage. Our findings are consistent with a model where entry wages are set according to a job ladder, and where firms anchor their internal wage structure on the minimum wage due to fairness or internal incentives issues.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33479,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w33614,The Macroeconomic Dynamics of Labor Market Policies,Erik Hurst; Patrick J. Kehoe; Elena Pastorino; Thomas Winberry,2025-03-27,"We develop a dynamic macroeconomic framework with worker heterogeneity, putty-clay adjustment frictions, and firm monopsony power to study the distributional impact of labor market policies over time. Our framework reconciles the well-known tension between low short-run and high long-run elasticities of substitution across inputs of production, especially among workers with different skills within a same education group. We use this framework to evaluate the effects of redistributive policies such as the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit. We argue that since these policies generate slow transition dynamics that can differ greatly in the short and long run, a serious assessment of their overall impact must take account of the entire time path of the responses they induce.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33614,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z

I exploit data from a large European trade program where firms from different countries supply labor services at the same location but face different payroll taxes and minimum wage rules. Country case studies and model-consistent gravity estimates show large trade responses to tax and regulatory reforms, with an elasticity of trade in services to labor costs larger than one. The results imply that absent regulatory and fiscal harmonization, export competitiveness depends, in part, on domestic labor market policies.
