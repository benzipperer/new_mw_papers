We study the near-doubling of the real minimum wage from 2000 to 2009 in Brazil, where 46% of the workforce is informal. Using labor force surveys covering the informal sector, we show the minimum wage exhibits near full passthrough to informal employees working in formal firms, about half of all informal employees. The formal-to-informal reallocation elasticity with respect to the formal wage is small: -0.28.

Using matched employer–employee administrative data, we find that the wage policy reduces wage inequality by 3–6 log points in the lower tail of the wage distribution, particularly among male workers and in the early years of its implementation. Analysis of job dynamics reveals that inequality persists in specific groups with higher job displacement rates (4–8 percentage points), primarily observed in the lower end of the wage distribution and in highly impacted sectors. Despite this displacement, employment effects are minimal for these groups and virtually non‐existent for those experiencing lower job displacement.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70018,new,2025-11-06,2025-11-06T00:00:00Z

w33720,Protection for Whom? The Political Economy of Protective Labor Laws for Women,Matthias Doepke; Hanno Foerster; Anne Hannusch; Michèle Tertilt,2025-04-24,"During the first half of the twentieth century, many US states enacted laws restricting women's labor market opportunities, including maximum hours restrictions, minimum wage laws, and night-shift bans. The era of so-called protective labor laws came to an end in the 1960s as a result of civil rights reforms. In this paper, we investigate the political economy behind the rise and fall of these laws. We argue that the main driver behind protective labor laws was men's desire to shield themselves from labor market competition. We spell out the mechanism through a politico-economic model in which singles and couples work in different sectors and vote on protective legislation. Restrictions are supported by single men and couples with male sole earners who compete with women for jobs. We show that the theory's predictions for when protective legislation will be introduced are well supported by US state-level evidence.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33720,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z

We find that government effectiveness and regulatory freedom positively correlate with pro-social behavior. We find that freedom from each of the following components of regulation; interest rate controls, binding minimum wages, worker dismissal protections, conscription, and administrative requirements; are correlated with prosocial behavior and are inversely correlated with Nash behavior.

w33167,Minimum Wages and Race Disparities,David Neumark; Jyotsana Kala,2024-11-14,"We provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of minimum wages on blacks, and on the relative impacts on blacks vs. whites. We study not only teenagers – the focus of much of the minimum wage-employment literature – but also other low-skill groups. We focus on employment, which has been the prime concern with the minimum wage research literature. We find evidence that job loss effects from higher minimum wages are more evident for blacks, and in contrast not very detectable for whites. Moreover, the effects of minimum wages are often large enough to generate adverse effects on earnings (and relative earnings) of blacks. Given strong residential segregation by race in the United States, the race difference in the effects of minimum wages implies that any adverse impacts fall on areas with a high black population share. We explore additional evidence on whether minimum wage effects are also more adverse in black areas, regardless of individual race. We find weak evidence of this heterogeneity, although it does accentuate the concentration of the adverse effects of minimum wages in areas where the black population is concentrated.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33167,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w33467,Labor Market Monopsony: Fundamentals and Frontiers,Patrick M. Kline,2025-02-13,"This chapter reviews the theory of monopsonistic wage setting, its empirical implications, and some puzzles the framework has struggled to explain. We begin by examining the fundamentals of monopsonistic wage determination. The core of the theory is a mapping from the distribution of worker outside options to wages. We study non-parametric shape restrictions that ensure this mapping is unique. Building on these results, we introduce a menu of tractable parametrizations of labor supply to the firm, some of which are shown to emerge naturally from equilibrium search models. Next, we review why wage markdowns do not necessarily signal inefficiency and discuss some criteria for assessing misallocation in a monopsony model with search frictions. Turning to the model’s empirical implications, we examine how the magnitude of productivity-wage passthrough depends on the super-elasticity of labor supply to the firm and establish that compensating differentials for firm amenities depend on the curvature of the outside option distribution. We show that firm-specific shifts in either productivity or amenities can be used as instruments to identify labor supply elasticities and review strategies for estimating non-constant elasticities. We then consider extensions of the basic model involving third-degree wage discrimination and examine their ability to rationalize patterns of worker-firm sorting. Monopsony models traditionally assume that firms commit to posted wages. Relaxing this assumption, we develop a connection between the first-order conditions of the monopsony model and models of bargaining with incomplete information. These models explain why bilateral inefficiencies may persist in the presence of negotiation, yield predictions about the response of within-firm wage dispersion to productivity shocks, and suggest reasons why some productivity shifters may not constitute excludable instruments. Next, we endogenize productivity by allowing for efficiency wages, non-constant returns to scale, and price-cost markups. Empirical monopsony estimates often suggest that firms enjoy implausibly large profit margins. We argue that allowing for non-constant labor supply elasticities and firm adjustment costs can potentially resolve this difficulty. Finally, we review why the strong passthrough of minimum wages to product prices presents a challenging puzzle for standard monopsony models and discuss potential reconciliations to this puzzle involving firm heterogeneity, quality upgrading, and lumpy price adjustment.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33467,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w34165,Robinson Meets Roy: Monopsony Power and Comparative Advantage,Mark Bils; Bariş Kaymak; Kai-Jie Wu,2025-08-21,"We provide a number of insights into the nature and consequences of monopsony power through the lens of comparative advantage, where employers’ power in wage setting stems from match-specific rents. Chief among them is that employers will apply larger wage markdowns to workers with greater comparative advantage at their firm. This leads to stronger monopsony power over more productive workers, provided the workers’ comparative advantage aligns with their absolute advantage. Using Brazilian administrative data, we confirm this prediction: monopsony disproportionately affects high-wage workers within firms and workers at high-paying firms. The model, calibrated to our estimates for Brazil, predicts that minimum wages increase both wages and formal employment for more productive workers while pushing less productive workers out of formal employment.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34165,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z

Using city-level data, we construct monopsony proxies based on labor flows and concentration. Minimum wages bind less in larger cities, consistent with the urban wage premium, and omitting this relationship overstates how labor market power reduces adverse employment effects of minimum wages. Nonetheless, accounting for city size, lower job market fluidity is linked to weaker negative employment effects, consistent with search models. By contrast, traditional concentration measures do not consistently predict variation in the effects of minimum wages.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33862,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z
w34188,Minimum Wages and the Distribution of Firm Wage Premia,Marcelo L. Bergolo; Rodrigo Ceni; Mathias Fondo; Damián Vergara,2025-08-29,"This paper leverages a large minimum wage reform in Uruguay to study the effects of minimum wages on the distribution of firm wage premia. Wage inequality decreased substantially after the reform, with almost all of the decrease attributed to a reduction in between-firm inequality. AKM variance decompositions show that the relative variance of firm fixed effects substantially decreased after the reform. A time-varying AKM model reveals that this pattern was driven by a compression in the distribution of firm fixed effects, with low-paying firms increasing their fixed effect after the minimum wage increase. Both firm-level and worker-level difference-in-differences analyses show that the minimum wage reform had a causal effect on the compression in the distribution of firm wage premia. The results suggest that minimum wages can increase the supply of ""good jobs"" by ""making bad jobs better"", in addition to reallocating workers towards ""good jobs"".",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34188,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z

Using administrative data from thousands of research labs linked to student career outcomes and a difference-in-differences design, we show that state minimum wage increases reduce employment of undergraduate research assistants in labs by 7.4%. Undergraduates exposed to these minimum wage increases graduate with 18.1% fewer quarters of lab experience. Using minimum wage changes as an instrumental variable, we estimate that one fewer quarter working in a lab, particularly early in college, reduces the probability of working in the life sciences industry by 2 percentage points and of pursuing doctoral education by 7 percentage points. These effects are attenuated for students supported by the Federal Work-Study program. Our findings highlight how labor market policies can shape the career paths of future scientists and the importance of budget flexibility for principal investigators providing undergraduates with research experience.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34244,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z

A long-run analysis shows strong earnings growth for these workers in subsequent decades, becoming indistinguishable from peers earning modestly more initially. Most of this growth is due to the steep earnings trajectories of young workers. Older workers earning minimum wages show a modest dip in earnings at that moment compared to earlier and later periods.

In unadjusted data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, we find that employment in California's fast food sector declined by 2.7 percent relative to employment in the fast food sector elsewhere in the United States from September 2023 through September 2024. Adjusting for pre-AB 1228 trends increases this differential decline to 3.2 percent, while netting out the equivalent employment changes in non-minimum-wage-intensive industries further increases the decline.

Townsend,2025-02-13,"This paper proposes an empirical approach to decompose the distributional effects of minimum wages into effects for workers moving out of employment, workers moving into employment, and workers continuing in employment. We estimate the effects of the minimum wage on the hazard rate for wages, which provides a convenient way of re-scaling the wage distribution to control for possible employment effects. We find that minimum wage increases do not result in an abnormal concentration of Job Leavers below the new minimum wage, which is inconsistent with employment effects predicted by a neoclassical model. We also find that, for Job Stayers, the spike and spillover effects of the minimum wage are simply shifted right to the new minimum wage. Our findings are consistent with a model where entry wages are set according to a job ladder, and where firms anchor their internal wage structure on the minimum wage due to fairness or internal incentives issues.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33479,new,2025-11-05,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z

Our framework reconciles the well-known tension between low short-run and high long-run elasticities of substitution across inputs of production, especially among workers with different skills within a same education group. We use this framework to evaluate the effects of redistributive policies such as the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit.

Using comprehensive survey data, we are able to measure the regional bite of the minimum wage in 2014, just before its introduction, as well as in 2018, before it was raised substantially in several steps. The introduction mainly affected the labour market in East Germany, while the minimum wage increases increasingly affected low-wage regions in West Germany, with about one third of regions changing their (binary) treatment status between 2014 and 2018. We use different specifications and extensions of the canonical difference-in-differences approach, as well as a set of new estimators that allow unbiased effect estimation with a staggered treatment adoption and heterogeneous treatment effects. Our results show a small negative effect on total dependent employment of 0.5%, driven by a significant reduction in marginal employment of 2.4%.

By constructing a flow-based index, I find that concentration is generally low across markets but varies across industries. Then, I use a Two-Stage Least Squares (TSLS) strategy based on the different exposures of industries to horizontal mergers. I find that mergers increase concentration, which in turn reduces wages by −0.14 and −0.07 and hires by −0.77 and −0.68%age points. I also find that (1) concentration does not affect the likelihood of a permanent hire but increases the probability that, when a temporary worker is renewed, the contract is again temporary; (2) men are affected by concentration only through wages, while women are less affected but also through job security; (3) estimates magnitude increases in concentration levels.",Oxford Economic Papers,https://doi.org/10.1093/oep/gpae050,old,2025-10-24,2025-10-24T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W4407380164,Politicising Commodification: European Governance and Labour Politics From the Financial Crisis to the Covid Emergency,Paul Marginson,2025-02-07,"Politicising Commodification provides a path-breaking, comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the nature and impact of the European Union's New Economic Governance (NEG) policy regime on employment relations (ER) and public service provision from its ad hoc inception in 2009, under the financial crisis, through to the Covid emergency and its immediate aftermath. It also explores the transnational collective protest actions by trade unions and social movements that the NEG and other forms of EU intervention triggered. It does so by drawing on an in-depth, three-dimensional comparison of: the two policy areas; three sectors (transport, water and healthcare); at EU level and from the vantage point of four countries (Germany, Ireland, Italy and Romania). The first part elaborates the conceptual framework and research design; the second part examines the policy prescriptions emanating from the NEG, and the transnational collective action they prompted, for the two policy areas and three sectors, and presents a compelling comparative analysis. The final part identifies changes and continuities in the NEG regime under the Covid emergency. Work on the trajectory of EU integration since the mid-1980s launch of the EU's Single Market programme has distinguished between negative, market-making and positive, market-correcting integration measures and dynamics. Erne et al. replace this well-established distinction with that between vertical (political) integration and horizontal (market) integration: whilst the character of the latter is inherently marketing-making, the former can be either market-making or market-correcting. Building on this insight, they frame vertical market-making measures as being commodifying, subjecting labour and public services to market processes, and their market-correcting counterparts as de-commodifying, protecting them from such processes. The European Union's existing mechanisms of economic and social governance, contend Erne et al., were found wanting in the face of the severe economic imbalances and associated jeopardy to Economic and Monetary Union resulting from the financial crisis. The NEG enabled the EU authorities (the Commission and the Council) to prescribe and enforce policy changes deemed economically necessary, including in fields hitherto shielded by the EU's Treaty from vertical political intervention, including collective wage bargaining. Initially, an ad hoc mechanism to govern the Memoranda of Understandings (MoUs) reached with Member States receiving financial bailouts, the NEG was formalised as an additional EU-wide instrument of governance in 2011. Its essence mimics the private governance arrangements through which transnational companies control their subsidiaries, including use of benchmarking of key performance indicators; financial awards and sanctions; and ad hoc policy prescriptions, in an ongoing annual cycle covering each member state. Unlike other modes of EU governance, 'NEG does not follow [the] logic of democratic interest intermediation. It is instead a new policymaking space at the borderline of democracy, bypassing national and European parliaments and social partners' (p. 33). Erne et al. observe that horizontal (market) integration and vertical (political) integration offer different 'crystallisation points' (p. 44) for countervailing collective action by trade unions and social movements. Vertical measures are more tangible and hence more readily politicised and contested. However, compared with the universal impacts across member states of proposed EU directives, the NEG's policy prescriptions are country specific, presenting more of an obstacle to transnational mobilisation: the NEG 'risks being a supranational regime that nationalises social conflict' (p. 50). The four countries differ in their position, core or periphery, within the EU's political economy; and their location within the policy enforcement spectrum of the NEG's regime. Under MoUs, countries are deemed subject to 'very significant' coercive power from the EU authorities; under the EU's corrective macro-economic procedure, they are subject to 'significant' coercive power; otherwise, under 'softer' EU policy and surveillance frameworks, countries are subject to 'weak' coercive power (p. 86). A mix of methods underpins the extensive European- and national-level fieldwork. For the analysis of NEG policy prescriptions, the commodification/de-commodification dichotomy is operationalised along quantitative and qualitative dimensions, contrasting curtailment or expansion of resources and marketising or de-marketising processes, respectively. For ER, the focus is on wage levels, collective wage bargaining arrangements and hiring and firing mechanisms. For public services, and the three sectors, the focus is on resource levels, governance mechanisms for service provision and citizens' access to services. Comparing the two policy areas, commodifying policy prescriptions predominate numerically and in their coercive power on both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. Prescriptions for public services point more consistently in a commodifying direction than those for ER, reflecting lesser marketizing pressures from horizontal integration on public services than ER. The pattern across sectors evidences some variation: whilst qualitative policy prescriptions are invariably commodifying–as are quantitative ones in healthcare–quantitative prescriptions in transport and water tend to be de-commodifying, tasking governments to invest in infrastructures. While the coercive power of commodifying prescriptions tends to be (very) significant, that of de-commodifying ones is weak. Across the two policy areas and three sectors, Erne et al. demonstrate that NEG policy prescriptions are driven by an 'overarching commodification policy script' (p. 297), particularly on the qualitative dimension, that is, driving forward marketisation. The finding is salient: the focus of much debate on the NEG has been on its quantitative impact (i.e., austerity). Yet, its qualitative impact is more consequential and more difficult to reverse. Drawing on their original database of transnational collective protest actions, Erne et al. find that proposed European legislation with a commodifying objective is the predominant trigger. In contrast, transnational protests triggered by NEG policy prescriptions account for under 10% of those targeted at the EU authorities post-2009–underlining the greater obstacles to cross-border mobilisation. This is attributed to the variable geography of the NEG's enforcement regime, involving markedly different degrees of coercive power between countries, as well as its nationally differentiated policy prescriptions. Inherent limitations of the NEG are identified: unlike the constituent elements of a TNC, electorates can ditch managements (i.e., governments) implementing unpopular, EU-mandated policies and elect alternative ones in their place; policy prescriptions are uneven in their impact across countries, and through time those with weak coercive powers are frequently ignored. Hence, the European authorities continued recourse to ordinary legislative initiatives (i.e., directives). These are more equal in their impact across countries, but also more open to transnational contestation. Changes to the NEG regime were instigated to meet the exigencies of the Covid emergency: the coercive macro-economic imbalance procedure was suspended, and a substantial EU-wide Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) was launched. The focus on country-specific policy prescriptions continued. Disbursements to countries from the RRF are conditional on their implementation, augmenting the EU authorities' coercive power. The prescriptive trajectories in the two policy areas, however, 'pointed in opposite directions' (p. 348). Public services continued to be subject to commodifying prescriptions to further marketise provision, whereas ER experienced a sharp policy turn in a de-commodifying direction. The few policy prescriptions addressing ER were de-commodifying, whilst new market-correcting legislation was enacted, notably the 2022 Adequate Minimum Wages Directive. This also promotes sectoral collective wage bargaining: paradoxically, bringing wage-setting within the scope of EU governance under the NEG regime paved the way for this substantial de-commodifying measure. Politicising Commodification stands as a likely enduring reference work on the NEG, EU governance more broadly, and (transnational) labour and social movement politics. The issue of generalisation to other country vantage points and other sectors is left open: would the perspective from one of the Visegrad or Nordic countries confirm or question (some) findings?

In this article, the author compiles new, comprehensive data on the costs that minimum wage violators incur when non-compliance is detected. In both countries, the costs violators face are often little more than the money they saved by underpaying. To have an incentive to comply under existing penalty regimes, typical US firms would thus have to expect a 47% to 83% probability of detection by the Department of Labor (DOL), or a 25% probability of a successful Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) suit. In the United Kingdom, typical firms would have to expect a 44% to 56% probability of detection. Actual probabilities of detection are substantially lower than this for many firms and would likely remain so even with realistic increases in enforcement capacity. Improved enforcement alone is thus insufficient: Expected penalties must also substantially increase to ensure that most firms have an incentive to comply.",Industrial and Labor Relations Review,https://doi.org/10.1177/00197939241299417,updated,2025-10-24,2025-11-04T05:41:42Z

We exploit the variation in the “bite” of the minimum wage across region‐industry cells, employing data from the Greek Labour Force Survey over the period 2015–2020. Using a Difference‐in‐Differences strategy, we estimate unconditional quantile regressions that yield economically important effects, at the bottom end of the earnings distribution. In particular, the estimated coefficients suggest a 14% and 7% rise in the wages for workers concentrated around the 10th and the 20th percentile, respectively. Importantly, we find that this does not come at the expense of disemployment effects, either at the extensive or at the intensive margin.",Labour,https://doi.org/10.1111/labr.12284,updated,2025-10-24,2025-11-04T05:41:42Z

We find that progression out of minimum wage jobs is frequent, although most workers remain low paid. Using hazard rate models, we find a short‐lived negative effect on progression associated with the introduction of the National Living Wage in 2016. In subsequent years, we find no evidence of significant adverse effects.

Using data from the period 2003–2019 and a stacked difference‐in‐differences regression model that accounts for dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects, we explore the relationship between minimum wages and teenage childbearing in the United States. We find no evidence of a systematic, negative relationship between minimum wages and childbearing among 15‐ through 19‐year‐olds.

Sabia,2025-04-21,"Abstract This study re-examines Dube (2019), which finds large and statistically significant poverty-reducing effects of the minimum wage. We show that his estimated elasticities are fragile and sensitive to (1) time period under study, (2) choice of macroeconomic controls, (3) limiting counterfactuals to geographically proximate states (“close controls”), which poorly match treatment states' pre-treatment poverty trends, and (4) accounting for potential bias caused by heterogeneous and dynamic treatment effects. Using data spanning nearly four decades from the March Current Population Survey and a dynamic difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, we find that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 0.17 percent increase in the probability of longer-run poverty among all persons. With 95% confidence, we can rule out long-run poverty elasticities with respect to the minimum wage of less than -0.129. Our null results persist across a variety of DiD estimation strategies, including two-way fixed effects, stacked DiD, Callaway and Sant'Anna, and synthetic DiD. We conclude that, to date, the preponderance of evidence suggests that minimum wage increases are an ineffective policy strategy for alleviating poverty.",The Review of Economics and Statistics,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01590,old,2025-10-24,2025-10-24T00:00:00Z

https://openalex.org/W4411465828,Minimum Wages and Homelessness,Seth J. Hill,2025-06-19,"ABSTRACT Economic theory offers competing predictions about how minimum wage policies might affect homelessness. While minimum wages might reduce homelessness by raising incomes, they could also trigger employment disruptions and negative income shocks identified in the literature as proximate causes of homelessness. Policy effects might be heterogeneous because the risk factors for homelessness—substance abuse, mental illness, unstable support network, and so on—correlate with lower labor market competitiveness. Using synthetic and local‐projection difference‐in‐differences methods with Department of Housing and Urban Development point‐in‐time counts, I find minimum wage increases between 2006 and 2019 led to more homelessness in American municipalities. This finding could help explain why homelessness surged in places that substantially increased minimum wages like New York, Seattle, and San Francisco while falling in localities with inflation‐adjusted declines. Further analysis suggests employment effects more likely drove these increases than housing prices or migration. The findings highlight distributional consequences of minimum wage policies and add to our understanding of homelessness.",Southern Economic Journal,https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12779,old,2025-10-24,2025-10-24T00:00:00Z

In 2010, the tax was raised from very low levels to 170% of the minimum wage cost associated with meeting the quota. We employ a regression discontinuity design on firm‐level data to estimate the effects of the policy and provide a lower‐bound estimate to account for the potential bias resulting from firms bunching below the threshold. Firms respond to the quota by hiring 0.24–0.29 additional workers with disabilities, with a lower bound estimate of 0.12–0.17. However, about two‐thirds of the quota is not fulfilled, which is puzzling as the tax is higher than the minimum wage cost of a worker with disabilities. Our model shows that high hiring costs associated with employing individuals with disabilities might be an important factor behind this anomaly. We test this hypothesis by showing that the effect is weaker in regions with a low share of individuals with disabilities, implying that without adequate policies targeting the removal of supply‐side barriers to the employment of people with disabilities, even strong demand‐side financial incentives cannot achieve their goals.",Economica,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecca.12568,old,2025-10-24,2025-10-24T00:00:00Z

Leveraging a period of stability in minimum wages (2000–2007) and two distinct national geocoded databases of establishments, we explore how indexing affected employment in Oregon restaurants, one of the earliest indexing states (2003). Nearest‐neighbor matching is used as a preprocessing step before regression, pairing individual restaurants in Oregon to restaurants with similar characteristics in states where the minimum wage was unchanged. We find evidence that establishment employment falls 3.6% after indexing, implying an employment elasticity of −0.18.",Economic Inquiry,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecin.13284,old,2025-10-24,2025-10-24T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W4413343041,"Do Higher Tipped Minimum Wages Reduce Race, Ethnic, or Gender Earnings Gaps for Restaurant Workers?",David Neumark; Emma Wohl,2025-08-19,"ABSTRACT One of the arguments increasingly made to support large minimum wage increases is that they decrease wage or earnings gaps for minorities or women. The argument is often made with particular reference to higher tipped minimum wages for restaurant workers, because of discrimination in tipping that is immune to equal pay policy requirements. Of course, even if higher tipped minimum wages reduce hourly pay differences between groups, increases in tipped minimum wages can reduce employment or hours among restaurant workers, and these effects could differ by race and gender, so implications for hourly earnings do not necessarily extend to overall earnings. We estimate the impact of variation in tipped minimum wages—or, equivalently, tip credits—on earnings of restaurant workers (which ignores employment variation but incorporates hours variation). We find that tipped minimum wages raise hourly earnings of women, but not of Blacks or Hispanics. But tipped minimum wages generally do not raise weekly earnings for these groups (because of hours declines for women). In contrast, regular minimum wages boost hourly and weekly earnings of all three groups of restaurant workers, with the effects arising from non‐tipped workers.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70003,old,2025-10-24,2025-10-24T00:00:00Z

Notably, a higher minimum wage is not associated with meaningful reductions in maternal work hours and weeks worked. Overall, we find that family earnings have little effect on child achievement test scores. OLS estimates are positive, but very small.

These statistics are produced using official weights designed to make the achieved sample in each year representative of the population of employee jobs in Britain by gender, age, occupation and region. However, we show that jobs in small, young, private‐sector organisations remain significantly under‐represented after applying these weights. To address this issue, we develop new weights and demonstrate their importance through policy‐relevant examples. Our new estimates suggest that the bite of the National Living Wage is greater than previously reported, and the gender pay gap is wider. We conclude that a new official review of the methodology for ASHE is merited to improve the accuracy and reliability of data informing earnings analysis and research in the United Kingdom.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70010,old,2025-10-24,2025-10-24T00:00:00Z

However, existing theories such as routine‐biased technological change (RBTC) or task offshoring fail to explain this trend. We propose a new explanation based on occupational autonomy. Autonomy measures workers' control and influence over their work process based on the tasks required in an occupation. Analysing individual‐level data from the EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions, we reveal a rising autonomy wage premium, that is, higher wage growth for occupations with higher autonomy, which accurately predicts the observed occupational wage divergence. We also find that the autonomy premium increases more rapidly in countries and industries with greater employee monitoring and outsourcing, as well as in countries with declining minimum wages. These findings imply that low‐autonomy occupations have been disadvantaged by recent socioeconomic trends that have altered power relations in the workplace. Notably, our analysis does not support previous explanations for occupational wage trends based on RBTC or task offshoring.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70003,old,2025-10-24,2025-10-24T00:00:00Z
