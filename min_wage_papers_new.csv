https://openalex.org/W4405889145,Price Floors and Employer Preferences: Evidence from a Minimum Wage Experiment,John J. Horton,2024-12-30,"Firms posting job openings in an online labor market were randomly assigned minimum hourly wages. When facing a minimum wage, fewer firms hired, but those they did hire paid higher wages. Hoursworked fell substantially. Treated firms shifted to hiring more productive workers. Using the platform's imposition of a market-wide minimum wage after the experiment, I find that many of the experimental results also hold in equilibrium, including the substitution towards more productive workers. However, there was also a large reduction in the number of jobs posted for which the minimum wage would likely bind.

https://openalex.org/W4406965375,"Minimum Wages, Efficiency, and Welfare",David Berger; Kyle Herkenhoff; Simon Mongey,2025-01-01,"Many argue that minimum wages can prevent efficiency losses from monopsony power. We assess this argument in a general equilibrium model of oligopsonistic labor markets with heterogeneous workers and firms. We decompose welfare gains into an efficiency component that captures reductions in monopsony power and a redistributive component that captures the way minimum wages shift resources across people. The minimum wage that maximizes the efficiency component of welfare lies below $8.00 and yields gains worth less than 0.2% of lifetime consumption. When we add back in Utilitarian redistributive motives, the optimal minimum wage is $11 and redistribution accounts for 102.5% of the resulting welfare gains, implying offsetting efficiency losses of −2.5%. The reason a minimum wage struggles to deliver efficiency gains is that with realistic firm productivity dispersion, a minimum wage that eliminates monopsony power at one firm causes severe rationing at another. These results hold under an EITC and progressive labor income taxes calibrated to the U.S. economy.",Econometrica,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta21466,new,2025-10-23,2025-10-23
https://openalex.org/W4412518030,The Impact of a Rising Wage Floor on Labour Mobility Across Firms,John Forth; Carl Singleton; Alex Bryson; Van Phan; Felix Ritchie; Lucy Stokes; Damian Whittard,2025-07-21,"ABSTRACT In April 2016, the National Living Wage (NLW) raised the statutory wage floor for employees in the United Kingdom aged 25 and above by 50 pence per hour. This uprating was almost double any in the previous decade and expanded the share of jobs covered by the wage floor by around 50%. Using a difference‐in‐differences approach with linked employer–employee data from the UK's Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, we examine how the introduction and uprating of the NLW affected the likelihood of minimum‐wage employees changing firms. We find some evidence that the NLW reduced the rate of job‐to‐job transitions among such workers, consistent with predictions that an increase in the wage floor discourages job search. However, we find no evidence that the NLW affected differences in job mobility between minimum wage workers and their co‐workers in the same firm. Together, these findings suggest that the increased wage floor made quits less attractive to minimum‐wage workers in firms with limited opportunities for progression.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70008,new,2025-10-23,2025-10-23

To succeed, they must coordinate members’ views (consensus building) and actions (mobilization). We study union leaders within Myanmar’s burgeoning labor movement. Union leaders are positively selected on both ability and personality traits that enable them to influence others, yet they earn lower wages. In group discussions about workers’ views on an upcoming national minimum wage negotiation, randomly embedded leaders build consensus around the union’s preferred policy. In an experiment that mimics individual decision-making in a collective action setup, leaders increase mobilization through coordination.

https://openalex.org/W4407682098,"The Race Between Education, Technology, and the Minimum Wage",Jonathan Vogel,2025-02-18,Abstract What is the impact of the real minimum wage on wages and inequality? I develop a theory that nests “The Race Between Education and Technology.” The theory predicts that the impact of changes in minimum wages is initially small but grows over time. I present empirical evidence of these dynamic effects: the elasticity of real wages grows substantially over a three-year period. I additionally show that minimum wages help rationalize a considerable decline in real wages of low-education workers in the 1980s and play a role in shaping the evolution of the U.S. college premium.,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaf014,new,2025-10-23,2025-10-23
https://openalex.org/W4410015841,A Comparison of Approaches for Identifying Minimum Wage Workers: Direct Question Versus Administrative Earnings Data,Paul Redmond; Elisa Staffa; Séamus McGuinness,2025-04-30,"ABSTRACT The ability to identify minimum wage employees is essential for minimum wage research. When the minimum wage is set at an hourly rate, such as in Ireland, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, researchers often combine monthly or weekly earnings data with self‐reported hours worked to calculate an hourly wage to determine if a worker is on minimum wage. This may lead to misclassification, whereby higher paid employees are misclassified as minimum wage employees or vice versa. An alternative, but less common, approach for identifying minimum wage employees is to use a direct survey question. Ireland is the only country in Europe whose labour force survey includes both linked administrative earnings data and a direct minimum wage question, thereby facilitating a comparison of both approaches. When studying the incidence, characteristics and outcomes associated with minimum wages, we show that the choice of approach (administrative data vs. survey question) can produce different results. We discuss the limitations of each approach when it comes to implementing difference‐in‐differences analysis to study the impacts of a minimum wage increase. We then combine useful features from both approaches to come up with a difference‐in‐differences estimate that overcomes some of the limitations that exist when using either approach on its own. We argue that the addition of a standardised minimum wage question in labour force surveys across Europe would allow researchers to provide more robust estimates on the impacts of minimum wage changes, while also facilitating cross‐country minimum wage research.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12886,new,2025-10-23,2025-10-23

On average, raising the minimum wage reduces enrolment in all countries assessed. The minimum wage has a somewhat moderate positive effect on training in the United States and no significant training effect elsewhere. There is no publication bias in the formal education and modest bias in the training literature. Heterogeneity among reported estimates is primarily driven by data differences, alternative specifications and measures of the relevant variables.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12881,new,2025-10-23,2025-10-23
https://openalex.org/W4408165652,Voluntary Minimum Wages: The Local Labor Market Effects of National Retailer Policies,Ellora Derenoncourt; David Weil,2025-03-05,"Abstract Low unionization rates, a falling real federal minimum wage, and outsourcing have hampered wage growth in the low-wage sector in the US for several decades. In recent years (2014-2023), a number of large private retailers – including some of the largest employers in the U.S. – have opted to institute or raise company-wide, voluntary minimum wages (VMWs) for their employees. We use anonymized payroll data from a large credit bureau and a major payroll provider to study the effects of these national retailer policies on adopting employers’ own wages and employment as well as their spillovers to other employers in shared local labor markets, variously defined. Using stacked event studies centered around multiple VMW events and a continuous treatment variable defined as the gap between local area wages and the company minimum, we find that VMWs result in sizable wage increases and reductions in turnover at the companies that implemented them. Turning to wages at other companies, we estimate small, often economically negligible, spillover effects across multiple measures of exposure to VMWs and numerous definitions of relevant competitors, including firms connected by worker flows. Together, the evidence points to little role for strategic interactions in the transmission of large retailers’ wage policies to other firms. Voluntary minimum wage policies have affected over 3 million jobs at adopting employers, yet their impact on the broader labor market is limited.",The Quarterly Journal of Economics,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaf016,new,2025-10-23,2025-10-23
